# Go-GC

Project built with [Gini](https://gini-webserver.up.railway.app/)

An educational garbage collector written in Go.

This project is a **toy implementation** of a garbage collector built to explore how GC algorithms work under the hood (mark-and-sweep, object graphs, roots, etc.).
It is **not** a replacement for Go’s runtime GC, but a learning-focused experiment.
